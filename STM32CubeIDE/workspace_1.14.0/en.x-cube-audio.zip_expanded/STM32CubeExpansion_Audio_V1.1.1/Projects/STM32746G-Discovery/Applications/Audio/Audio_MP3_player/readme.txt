@par Application Description 

This application is made to demonstrate MP3 decoder integration,
it can decode audio data in MP3 format or WAV format.
Moreover this application shows how to configure and use the sample rate converter
libraries, taking as use case audio playback from USB storage. It can encode audio
stream from microphones to USB key.

Any wave or mp3 file stored under the USB Key can be opened using the FatFs 
file system and transferred to the internal SRAM using the file system. 
All the files properties are read from the File Header.

++++++ Player ++++++

In player mode, the MP3 module decodes audio stereo files from USB key
(in WAV or MP3 format) and send the PCM audio stream to headphones.
If the selected input file is not stereo this example will exit displaying
an error message.
The player uses a mechanism of memory pool to manage write and read buffer sizes
between input MP3 encoded data and output SRC converted to 10ms blocks 
of stereo samples at 48kHz. When space available in MemPool Buffer, it writes
decoded data frame to MemPool and at same time with higher priority, it reads
audio data packets from MemPool to be rate adapted by SRC and stream out to headphones.  
 
The MP3 decoder process frames of 1152 stereo samples in 16-bits.
The SRC converts the detected sample rate from audio file to 48Khz Fs.
Detailed information about the SRC libraries (SRC236 and SRC441) are available at:
  \Middlewares\ST\STM32_Audio\Addons\SRC236\Release_Notes.html
  \Middlewares\ST\STM32_Audio\Addons\SRC441\Release_Notes.html
The new sample buffer is finally sent to audio codec.
The SRC are optimized in memory to work with small buffers (10ms @24khz, 5ms @48khz, 2,5ms @96khz).

On the other hand, this example is such to provide always output to the audio codec at 48khz 
in blocks of 480 stereo samples (each 10ms) because the other AudioEffects features work on 
that scheduling. The aim is to easily combine this application with the other STM audio effects.
Therefore in order to provide a block of 480 stereo samples @48khz, 
it can be necessary to execute the SRC several times (e.g. 4 times if input wav is 96khz).

Two stereo buffer of 480 stereo samples in 16-bits are used in ping-pong  
to be able to read and decode regularly data from USB to be sent to audio codec.
The codec sees it as one buffer of 920 stereo samples, handled by DMA. 
- Using FatFs driver, at start the application reads from USB to fill the entire buffer 
(920 stereo samples)
- This buffer is sent to audio BSP which uses DMA mode to transfer data from MCU
to audio codec (16 bits)
- At DMA half transfer ISR, an indication is sent to application to indicate that 
half of the buffer has been sent (480 stereo samples)
- At DMA half transfer ISR exit, application can read from USB to fill the 1st part of the buffer
- At DMA transfer complete ISR, DMA transfer is requested to send 1st part of the buffer
- At DMA transfer complete ISR exit, application can read bytes from USB to fill
the 2nd part of the buffer
- When file size is reached, audio codec is stopped and a new play is requested.

A touch screen interface is used to navigate from a file to another (Next and Previous 
buttons), to change volume, pause playback and to quit playback menu by pressing Back button. 

Plug a headphone to hear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears. Default volume is 70%.

Note: The audio files provided under "/Utilities/Media/Audio" are based on a free 
music download from www.DanoSongs.com website and user can load his own audio 
(*.wav, *.mp3) files in the USB Key root.
For this application, only stereo audio input is supported and Audio frequency 
to the codec has to be always 48Khz (rate internally adapted with SRC).
It is recommended on STM32469I-Discovery board to limit updated information on LCD display to reduce
parasitic noise during dynamic reconfiguration of some module parameters. 

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STM32746G-Discovery board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.   

  - STM32746G-Discovery Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the STM32746G-Discovery board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable (FS mode: connector CN13).
    - Connect a headphone to connector CN10.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
